# Phonetic Visualizer Progress Tracker

## Current Status

The Phonetic Visualizer project is in an active development state, with a major refactoring effort underway to implement a generic visualizer architecture. The application is functional and can be used to visualize words with various visualization styles, but some technical improvements are still in progress.

### Overall Progress: 🟨 Partially Complete

- ✅ Core functionality is working
- ✅ Multiple visualization styles are implemented
- ✅ User interface is complete and functional
- 🔄 Refactoring to generic architecture is in progress
- ❌ Not all visualizers have been converted to the new system

## What Works

### Core Features

1. ✅ **Word Input**: Users can enter words to visualize
2. ✅ **Visualization Selection**: Users can select from multiple visualization styles
3. ✅ **Phonetic Breakdown**: Words are broken down into phonetic components
4. ✅ **Typewriter Animation**: Phonetic breakdown is displayed with a typewriter effect
5. ✅ **Zoom and Pan**: Canvas visualizations support zoom and pan functionality

### Visualizers

1. ✅ **Tree Visualizer**: Displays phonetic components in a hierarchical tree structure
2. ✅ **Spiral Visualizer**: Arranges phonetic components in a spiral pattern
3. ✅ **Ripple Visualizers** (3 variants): Shows phonetic components with various ripple effects
4. ✅ **Fractal Visualizer**: Creates fractal patterns based on phonetic components
5. ✅ **Constellation Visualizer**: Arranges phonetic components in a constellation-like pattern
6. ✅ **Waveform Visualizer**: Displays phonetic components as audio waveforms with playback
7. ✅ **Typography Visualizer**: Animates phonetic components with typography effects

### Technical Implementation

1. ✅ **Generic Visualizer Base**: Created a base system for standardizing visualizer implementation
2. ✅ **Registration System**: Implemented a system for visualizers to register themselves
3. ✅ **State Management**: Centralized state management with templates for each visualizer
4. ✅ **Animation Framework**: Standardized approach to animations with proper cleanup
5. ✅ **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for the visualizer system

## What's Left to Build

### Refactoring Tasks

1. ✅ **Ripple Visualizer Refactoring**: Converted ripple visualizers to use the new system
2. 🔄 **Refactor Remaining Visualizers (Combined Approach)**: Update remaining visualizers to use both the generic architecture and dynamic canvas creation system in a single pass
   - ✅ Constellation visualizer
   - ❌ Fractal visualizer
   - ✅ Tree visualizer
   - ❌ Waveform visualizer

### Enhancement Tasks

1. ✅ **Dynamic Canvas Creation**: Implemented automatic canvas creation for new visualizers
2. ✅ **Smooth Zoom and Pan**: Enhanced zoom/pan with smooth animation and better interaction
3. ❌ **Improved Error Handling**: Add better error handling for edge cases
4. ❌ **Performance Optimizations**: Optimize canvas operations for better performance
5. ❌ **Browser Compatibility Improvements**: Ensure consistent behavior across browsers

### Potential Future Features

1. ❌ **Preset System**: Allow saving and loading visualization presets
2. ❌ **Responsive Design Improvements**: Better support for different screen sizes
3. ❌ **Additional Visualizers**: Implement more visualization styles
4. ❌ **Export Functionality**: Allow exporting visualizations as images

## Known Issues

### Technical Issues

1. 🐛 **Memory Leaks**: Potential memory leaks if animation frames aren't properly canceled
2. 🐛 **Canvas Sizing**: Canvas dimensions may not be set correctly if container is not visible
3. 🐛 **Waveform Audio**: Waveform visualizer's audio handling could be improved
4. 🐛 **Browser Differences**: Some canvas operations may behave differently across browsers
5. ✅ **Tree Visualizer Issues**: Fixed issues with the tree visualizer not rendering properly when initially selected, renamed to "Recursive Tree", and made it first in the visualizer list

### Visual Issues

1. 🐛 **Character Overlapping**: In some visualizations, characters may overlap with complex words
2. 🐛 **Animation Timing**: Some animations may not complete properly with very short words
3. 🐛 **Zoom Limitations**: Extreme zoom levels may cause rendering issues
4. 🐛 **Transform Precision**: Zoom and pan transforms may have precision issues in some cases
5. 🐛 **Performance During Zoom**: Large filled areas and gradients can cause jittery zoom animations

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Architecture Evolution

1. **Initial Implementation**: Each visualizer had its own implementation with significant code duplication
2. **Refactoring Plan**: Decided to create a generic architecture to reduce duplication and improve maintainability
3. **Current Approach**: Implementing a registration system with standardized interfaces for visualizers
4. **Refactoring Strategy**: Adopted a combined approach that implements both the generic architecture and dynamic canvas creation in a single pass for each visualizer, reducing redundant work and ensuring consistency

### Visualization Approach Evolution

1. **Early Visualizers**: Simple visualizations with basic animations
2. **Current Visualizers**: More complex visualizations with interactive elements and smooth animations
3. **Future Direction**: Moving toward a more plugin-based approach with dynamic loading

### State Management Evolution

1. **Initial Approach**: Separate state objects for each visualizer
2. **Current Approach**: Centralized state management with templates and standardized update methods
3. **Future Consideration**: Potential for more reactive state management with observers

## Recent Milestones

1. ✅ **Tree Visualizer Refactoring**: Successfully refactored the Tree visualizer to use the generic architecture and dynamic canvas creation system. Converted from SVG/D3.js to Canvas-based rendering with a sophisticated multi-pass layout algorithm that prevents line crossings. Implemented smooth zoom and pan functionality while maintaining the same visual style.
2. ✅ **Constellation Visualizer Refactoring**: Successfully refactored the Constellation visualizer to use both the generic architecture and dynamic canvas creation system. Fixed a critical hover detection issue with pan and zoom by correctly implementing the inverse transform calculation.
3. ✅ **Smooth Zoom and Pan**: Enhanced the zoom and pan functionality with smooth animations and mouse-centered zooming
4. ✅ **Dynamic Canvas Creation**: Implemented automatic canvas creation for new visualizers, eliminating the need to manually add HTML elements and update related functions
5. ✅ **Example Visualizer**: Added a new example visualizer that demonstrates the dynamic canvas creation system
6. ✅ **Ripple Visualizer Refactoring**: Successfully converted all three ripple visualizers to the new system and fixed pan/zoom functionality

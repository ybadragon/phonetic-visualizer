# Phonetic Visualizer Project Brief

## Core Requirements

1. Create an interactive web application that visualizes words based on their phonetic structure
2. Support multiple visualization styles that represent phonetic elements in different ways
3. Provide a clean, intuitive user interface for entering words and selecting visualizations
4. Implement smooth animations and transitions between visualization states
5. Ensure visualizations are aesthetically pleasing and informative
6. Allow for zoom and pan functionality to explore complex visualizations
7. Support typewriter-style animation for displaying the phonetic breakdown

## Project Goals

1. Demonstrate the relationship between written words and their phonetic components
2. Create a visually engaging tool for exploring language
3. Provide a flexible architecture that makes it easy to add new visualization types
4. Ensure good performance across different devices and browsers
5. Maintain clean, well-documented code that follows best practices

## Project Scope

### In Scope

- Web-based interface with text input and visualization selection
- Multiple visualization types (tree, spiral, ripple, fractal, constellation, waveform, typography)
- Phonetic breakdown of English words
- Animation and interactive elements
- Zoom and pan functionality for detailed exploration
- Typewriter animation for phonetic display

### Out of Scope

- Support for languages other than English
- Mobile-specific optimizations
- User accounts or saved visualizations
- Backend processing or database storage
- Audio pronunciation (except for waveform visualization)
- Integration with external APIs or services

## Technical Constraints

- Pure frontend implementation (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- No backend requirements
- Minimal external dependencies (currently only D3.js)
- Must work in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- No build process required (vanilla JS with ES modules)
